            Capstone Project - Investigation and Analysis of Network Traffic
            Sent by Android Social Media Applications
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            My capstone project dealt with analysing potential privacy risks
            stemming from various pieces of user information being collected and
            sent to back-end servers of applications without the users' explicit
            consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Privacy concerns were evaluated in my research by intercepting
            telemetry data sent in requests by social media applications to
            their respective servers. These requests were then decoded so that
            the contents of each request could be manually analysed. An
            evaluation of the potential privacy concerns aimed to provide social
            media users with more detail of how these applications can continue
            to track their users after they have opted-out of various privacy
            preserving settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was found that Twitter sends a large amount of sensitive user
            data tagged with short lived identifiers alongside longer lived
            identifiers. The idea behind using short lived identifiers is that
            they do not exist for long periods and thus, it is difficult to link
            them to specific events. This act is undermined by the fact that
            they are sent together with longer lived identifiers. This allows
            for the de-anonymisation of the short lived identifiers. By
            de-anonymising the short lived identifiers, a privacy concern
            becomes more prominent in that, detailed usage information can
            potentially be connected to a users' real identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data sent by Twitter contains several persistent identifiers
            which can be used to link back to a user(s) accessing the Twitter
            application through the same device. A large amount of data is
            logged by Twitter services without providing the user with a clear
            prompt to opt-out of this data collection. Requests are also sent to
            Google/Firebase Analytics which introduces the potential for
            tracking of users across applications through the use of these
            persistent identifiers. When compared against Mastodon, a social
            media platform that prioritises user privacy, it was concluded that
            very little data collection is actually necessary in order for a
            popular social media site to function and that Twitter is exploiting
            the trust of its users.

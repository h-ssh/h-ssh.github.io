            I am a Final Year Computer Science Student @
            <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/">Trinity College Dublin</a>

          <p>
            I am very interested in cyber security and ethical hacking so I
            thought I would make a page dedicated to my progression in the
            field. Since there are no available modules for me to take in
            University, I decided to take it upon myself to teach myself more
            about hacking.

                  I set up my virtual environment using virtualbox and an ISO
                  image of Kali Linux from the official kali linux website.

                  I learnt about the 5 stages of penetration testing in greater

                  1. Measuring privacy of android apps using mitmproxy through
                  raspi wifi AP
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Android apps, including system apps, often send messages to
                  multiple servers/network endpoints. Since a great many
                  messages are sent, manually analysing the privacy of the set
                  of network connections made by an app is time-consuming and
                  impractical. The aim of this project is to investigate methods
                  for automating this analysis so that it scales, and then
                  applying the developed methods to measurements from Android
                  handsets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The messages sent over Android network connections often
                  contain identifiers. Examples of privacy-preserving
                  identifiers include session identifiers that link a sequence
                  of messages together and single-use identifiers to avoid
                  processing of duplicate messages. These are quite private
                  because they do not persist for long periods and so make it
                  hard to link the messages to a specific handset or user.
                  However, apps sometimes also use much longer-lived identifiers
                  e.g. the handset phone number, the handset hardware serial
                  number, the Google user account email, the IMEI (which
                  uniquely identifies the handset SIM slot). There can be
                  legitimate reasons for this, but privacy best practice is to
                  only use such identifiers when it is strictly necessary, to
                  limit their use to a small number of connections, and to avoid
                  “joining” or linking short-lived identifiers with longer-lives
                  ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The goal of the project is to build a graph linking messages
                  sharing the same identifiers and then analysing the properties
                  of this graph e.g. the connected components (the component
                  with long-lived identifiers should be small and disconnected
                  from the other components). By measuring the identifier graph
                  properties we can hopefully develop a quantitative measure of
                  privacy that can be used to rank apps.

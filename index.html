                  Capstone Project - Investigation and Analysis of Network
                  Traffic Sent by Android Social Media Applications
                </h1>
                <p>
                  My capstone project dealt with analysing potential privacy
                  risks stemming from various pieces of user information being
                  collected and sent to back-end servers of applications without
                  a users' explicit consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Privacy concerns are evaluated in this research by
                  intercepting telemetry data sent in requests by social media
                  applications to their respective servers. These requests are
                  then decoded so that the contents of each request can be
                  manually analysed. An evaluation of the potential privacy
                  concerns aims to provide social media users with more detail
                  of how these applications can continue to track their users
                  after they have opted-out of various privacy preserving
                  settings.

                  It is found that Twitter sends a large amount of sensitive
                  user data tagged with short lived identifiers alongside longer
                  lived identifiers. The idea behind using short lived
                  identifiers is that they do not exist for long periods and
                  thus, it is difficult to link them to specific events. This
                  act is undermined by the fact that they are sent together with
                  longer lived identifiers. This allows for the de-anonymisation
                  of the short lived identifiers. By de-anonymising the short
                  lived identifiers, a privacy concern becomes more prominent in
                  that, detailed usage information can potentially be connected
                  to a usersâ€™ real identity.
                </p>

                  The data sent by Twitter contains several persistent
                  identifiers which can be used to link back to a user(s)
                  accessing the Twitter application through the same device. A
                  large amount of data is logged by Twitter services without
                  providing the user with a clear decision to opt-out of this
                  data collection. Requests are also sent to Google/Firebase
                  Analytics which introduces the potential for tracking of users
                  across applications through the use of these persistent
                  identifiers. When compared against Mastodon, a social media
                  platform that prioritises user privacy, it is concluded that
                  very little data collection is necessary in order for a social
                  media site to operate.

                  Recently I was invited to take part in Google's FooBar
                  challenge, which at first looked like just a website to
                  practice problem solving skills. After looking online, I found
                  out that only certain people are invited to take part in the
                  challenge. The invitation came as a popup in my browser. It
                  spawned immediate intrigue and I found myself engrossed in the
                  challenging problems presented to me.

                  Recently I completed an online course dealing with topics in
                  cybersecurity. The course is very well structured and goes
                  into a lot of depth explaining relevant concepts. Given that I
                  already have a background in computer science, a large portion
                  of the course seemed like a refresher but it was definitely
                  beneficial nonetheless.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The course is broken up into 8 different topics, each being
                  taught by a specialist working at Google in that area.

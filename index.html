                  Capstone Project - Investigation and Analysis of Network
                  Traffic Sent by Android Social Media Applications
                </h3>
                <p>
                  My capstone project dealt with analysing potential privacy
                  risks stemming from various pieces of user information being
                  collected and sent to back-end servers of applications without
                  the users' explicit consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Privacy concerns were evaluated in my research by intercepting
                  telemetry data sent in requests by social media applications
                  to their respective servers. These requests were then decoded
                  so that the contents of each request could be manually
                  analysed. An evaluation of the potential privacy concerns
                  aimed to provide social media users with more detail of how
                  these applications can continue to track their users after
                  they have opted-out of various privacy preserving settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was found that Twitter sends a large amount of sensitive
                  user data tagged with short lived identifiers alongside longer
                  lived identifiers. The idea behind using short lived
                  identifiers is that they do not exist for long periods and
                  thus, it is difficult to link them to specific events. This
                  act is undermined by the fact that they are sent together with
                  longer lived identifiers. This allows for the de-anonymisation
                  of the short lived identifiers. By de-anonymising the short
                  lived identifiers, a privacy concern becomes more prominent in
                  that, detailed usage information can potentially be connected
                  to a users' real identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The data sent by Twitter contains several persistent
                  identifiers which can be used to link back to a user(s)
                  accessing the Twitter application through the same device. A
                  large amount of data is logged by Twitter services without
                  providing the user with a clear prompt to opt-out of this data
                  collection. Requests are also sent to Google/Firebase
                  Analytics which introduces the potential for tracking of users
                  across applications through the use of these persistent
                  identifiers. When compared against Mastodon, a social media
                  platform that prioritises user privacy, it was concluded that
                  very little data collection is actually necessary in order for
                  a popular social media site to function and that Twitter is
                  exploiting the trust of its users.

                <p>
                  Recently I was invited to take part in Google's FooBar
                  challenge. Originally the challenge was made for Google to
                  find talented programmers to hire.

                <p>
                  The challenge is split up into 5 levels and the user has the
                  option of completing each problem in either Python or Java. I
                  chose to use Python.

                <h3>Google Cybersecurity Certificate - Coursera</h3>
                <p>
                  Recently I completed an online course dealing with topics in
                  cybersecurity. The course is very well structured and goes
                  into a lot of depth explaining relevant concepts. Given that I
                  already have a background in computer science, a large portion
                  of the course seemed like a refresher but it was definitely
                  beneficial nonetheless.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The certificate is broken up into 8 courses, each being taught
                  by a specialist working at Google in a different area of
                  cybersecurity.

                    In the first course of the certificate, core security
                    concepts are introduced and the importance of security is
                    outlined. The roles of entry-level security analysts are
                    explored as well as skills related to the role. Next,
                    security frameworks and controls such as the CIA triad and
                    the NIST CSF are explained. Finally, common tools and
                    programming languages used by security analysts are explored
                    such as SIEM tools, playbooks, SQL and Python.

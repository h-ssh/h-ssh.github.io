            <h3>
              Capstone Project - Investigation and Analysis of Network Traffic
              Sent by Android Social Media Applications
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              My capstone project dealt with analysing potential privacy risks
              stemming from various pieces of user information being collected
              and sent to back-end servers of applications without the users'
              explicit consent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Privacy concerns were evaluated in my research by intercepting
              telemetry data sent in requests by social media applications to
              their respective servers. These requests were then decoded so that
              the contents of each request could be manually analysed. An
              evaluation of the potential privacy concerns aimed to provide
              social media users with more detail of how these applications can
              continue to track their users after they have opted-out of various
              privacy preserving settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was found that Twitter sends a large amount of sensitive user
              data tagged with short lived identifiers alongside longer lived
              identifiers. The idea behind using short lived identifiers is that
              they do not exist for long periods and thus, it is difficult to
              link them to specific events. This act is undermined by the fact
              that they are sent together with longer lived identifiers. This
              allows for the de-anonymisation of the short lived identifiers. By
              de-anonymising the short lived identifiers, a privacy concern
              becomes more prominent in that, detailed usage information can
              potentially be connected to a users' real identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data sent by Twitter contains several persistent identifiers
              which can be used to link back to a user(s) accessing the Twitter
              application through the same device. A large amount of data is
              logged by Twitter services without providing the user with a clear
              prompt to opt-out of this data collection. Requests are also sent
              to Google/Firebase Analytics which introduces the potential for
              tracking of users across applications through the use of these
              persistent identifiers. When compared against Mastodon, a social
              media platform that prioritises user privacy, it was concluded
              that very little data collection is actually necessary in order
              for a popular social media site to function and that Twitter is
              exploiting the trust of its users.

            <p>
              Recently I was invited to take part in Google's FooBar challenge.
              Originally the challenge was made for Google to find talented
              programmers to hire.
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge is split up into 5 levels and the user has the
              option of completing each problem in either Python or Java. I
              chose to use Python.

            <h3>Google Cybersecurity Certificate - Coursera</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Recently I completed an online course dealing with topics in
              cybersecurity. The course is very well structured and goes into a
              lot of depth explaining relevant concepts. Given that I already
              have a background in computer science, a large portion of the
              course seemed like a refresher but it was definitely beneficial
              nonetheless.
            </p>
            <p>
              The certificate is broken up into 8 courses, each being taught by
              a specialist working at Google in a different area of
              cybersecurity.
            </p>

              <!-- <ul>
                    In the first course of the certificate, core security
                    concepts are introduced and the importance of security is
                    outlined. The roles of entry-level security analysts are
                    explored as well as skills related to the role. Next,
                    security frameworks and controls such as the CIA triad and
                    the NIST CSF are explained. Finally, common tools and
                    programming languages used by security analysts are explored
                    such as SIEM tools, playbooks, SQL and Python.

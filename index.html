          <p>
            I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/">Trinity College Dublin</a> with upper second class honours in Computer Science.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very interested in cyber security and ethical hacking.
            Currently I am enrolled in a course on <a href="https://coursera.org">Coursera</a> to get the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. The course should be completed by the end of July 2023.

                  1. Capstone Project - Investigation and Analysis of Network Traffic Sent by Android Social Media Applications
                </h1>
                <p>
                My capstone project dealt with analysing potential privacy risks stemming from various pieces of user information being collected and sent  to back-end servers of applications without a users' explicit consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                Privacy concerns are evaluated in this research by intercepting telemetry data sent in
                requests by social media applications to their respective servers. These requests are
                then decoded so that the contents of each request can be manually analysed. An
                evaluation of the potential privacy concerns aims to provide social media users with
                more detail of how these applications can continue to track their users after they have
                opted-out of various privacy preserving settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is found that Twitter sends a large amount of sensitive user data tagged with short
                lived identifiers alongside longer lived identifiers. The idea behind using short lived
                identifiers is that they do not exist for long periods and thus, it is difficult to link
                them to specific events. This act is undermined by the fact that they are sent together
                with longer lived identifiers. This allows for the de-anonymisation of the short lived
                identifiers. By de-anonymising the short lived identifiers, a privacy concern becomes
                more prominent in that, detailed usage information can potentially be connected to a
                usersâ€™ real identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                The data sent by Twitter contains several persistent identifiers which can be used to
                link back to a user(s) accessing the Twitter application through the same device. A
                large amount of data is logged by Twitter services without providing the user with a
                clear decision to opt-out of this data collection. Requests are also sent to
                Google/Firebase Analytics which introduces the potential for tracking of users across
                applications through the use of these persistent identifiers. When compared against
                Mastodon, a social media platform that prioritises user privacy, it is concluded that
                very little data collection is necessary in order for a social media site to operate.
